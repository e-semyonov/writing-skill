# Phrase guide — Colloquial → Engineering

This table maps common colloquial requests to more precise, engineering-fluent phrasing to help form clearer technical prompts and improve communication between non‑technical and technical stakeholders.

How to use: copy the Engineering/Fluent Equivalent (middle column) when you want a concise, technically precise way to ask for work or analysis. Use the Tags column to quickly filter by topic (e.g., performance, architecture, process).
